# TODO App
Hello! This is a demo app for the lab in COSC 381!

The add-todo & add-date branches were merged into main branch (with a two-way merge in the process).
Then the add-todo & add-date branches were synced with the main branch.
Then different edits were made each to add-todo & add-date branches.
Then the add-todo & add-date branches were merged again into the main branch (this time with a conflict-resolving merge).
And all 3 branches were pushed to the remote repository

I am almost finished! Yay!
